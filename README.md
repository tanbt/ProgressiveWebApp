# To subscribe for push notification
* Generate key for push notification
  * at *functions* directory, run `npm run web-push generate-vapid-keys` to get public and private key
  * update the public key in app.js file, at `var vapidPublickey`
  * update the two keys in *functions/index.js*
* To deploy firebase, update firebase.json
  * on Windows: `npm --prefix %RESOURCE_DIR% run lint`
  * on MacOS or Linux: `npm --prefix $RESOURCE_DIR run lint`
  * on root folder, run `firebase login` then `firebase deploy`
* Run the website, update notification permission to `Ask (default)`
  * completely refresh the page (ctrl + shift + f5)
  * click ENABLE NOTIFICATIONS button, click `Allow`
  * check firebase Database to see if there's a new subscription

# How to update firebase function
* update the `index.js` file in *functions* folder
* in root folder (parent folder of *functions* folder), run `firebase deploy` 

# Commands:
* npm install
* change directory to *functions* folder, run `npm install`
* at root directory, run `npm start`

# How to Use
You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. Simply download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and go through the installation steps.

Once Node.js is installed, open your command prompt or terminal and **navigate into this project folder**. There, run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

Finally, run `npm start` to start the development server and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the running application.

## Troubleshooting
* In Windows, have to use Firebase CLI in `cmd`, not git bash 
* Cannot install npm because of permision of writing cache
** MacOS: sudo chown -R root /cache/path
* Cannot run *firebase deploy* because of *$RESOURCE_DIR*
** Have to stay at root folder, instead of `functions` folder
** The path to project location contains special characters (e.g. whitespace)
** in Windows, it's `%RESOURCE_DIR%`, in MacOS or Linux, it's `$RESOURCE_DIR`
