# How to Use
You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. Simply download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and go through the installation steps.

Once Node.js is installed, open your command prompt or terminal and **navigate into this project folder**. There, run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

Finally, run `npm start` to start the development server and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the running application.

## Troubleshooting
* In Windows, have to use Firebase CLI in `cmd`, not git bash 
* Cannot install npm because of permision of writing cache
** MacOS: sudo chown -R root /cache/path
* Cannot run *firebase deploy* because of *$RESOURCE_DIR*
** Have to stay at root folder, instead of `functions` folder
** The path to project location contains special characters (e.g. whitespace)
